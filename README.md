LWJGL-Skeleton
==============
Skeleton App and Pom for LWJGL.  Provides initial setup for an LWJGL java project.


**_Note:_**  LWJGL uses .dll (windows) and *. (nix) native dependencies with their jar files.  You must point the jar's to use these native files.

- For Eclipse - simplest way to do this is the google plugin [found here](https://code.google.com/p/mavennatives/)
